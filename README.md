# The Jollof rice 

4 Africans, a Namibian, a Nigerian, a Senegalese and a South African were having a discussion. The Nambian said to the Nigerian: 

>I really like Jollof rice.

The Nigerian replied
>Wow, then I will cook you some

The Senegalese cuts in and started explaining the origin of Jollof rice. The Senegalese explained that Jollof rice originated from Senegal since it was the name of an ancient senegalese empire.

An argument ensued which got the South African interested: 
>Well, if the Jollof rice came from Senegal and the Nigerian and adapted it, then it must be open source!

Said the South African.
