## OPEN SOURCE JOLLOF (THE SENEGALESE RECIPE)

### INGREDIENTS

#### For the Fish and Stuffing

- 1⁄4 cup finely chopped parsley
- 2 tsp. crushed red chile flakes
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 scallions, minced
- 1⁄4 small yellow onion, minced
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 8 (4–oz.) filets grouper or red snapper


#### For the main rice

- 1⁄2 cup canola or palm oil
- 2 medium yellow onions, roughly chopped
- 1 medium green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and roughly chopped
- 1 (12–oz.) can tomato paste
- 6 cups fish or vegetable stock
- 6 small carrots, halved crosswise
- 1 large eggplant, cut into large chunks, or 4 small Thai eggplants
- 1 medium turnip, peeled and cut into 12 wedges
- 1⁄2 cassava root, peeled and cut into 1 1⁄2″ chunks
- 1⁄3 cup dried white hibiscus flowers (optional; see below for ordering)
- 2 tbsp. tamarind paste
- 2 tbsp. fish sauce
- 4 cups basmati rice
- Lime wedges, to serve

### STEPS

- Make the fish and stuffing: Mix together parsley, chile flakes, garlic, scallion, onion, and salt and pepper in a bowl. Using a paring knife, cut a 2″ slit lengthwise in each fish filet; stuff filets with the herb mixture, and set aside.
- Make the thiéboudienne: Heat oil in an 8–qt. Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions and green pepper, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 10 minutes. Add tomato paste; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are very soft and paste is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Add stock, and bring to a boil.
- Reduce heat to medium-low, and add filets; cook until fish is just cooked through, about 18 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove filets and transfer to a plate, then cover to keep warm.
- Add carrots, eggplants, turnips, and cassava, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 40 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to a bowl; keep warm. Add hibiscus flowers (if using), tamarind paste, and fish sauce, and cook, stirring occasionally, until hibiscus flowers soften, about 5 minutes.
- Add rice, and stir to combine; reduce heat to low, and cook, covered, until rice is tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from heat, and fluff rice with a fork.
- To serve, divide fish, vegetables, and rice among serving plates; serve with lime wedges (for squeezing over fish).
